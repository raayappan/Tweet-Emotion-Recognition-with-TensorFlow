# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition-with-TensorFlow 
Create a recurrent neural network and train it on a tweet emotion dataset to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions. This is a multi class classification problem in the natural language processing domain. We will be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.
